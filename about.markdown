Hi

I'm a long time SQL Server DBA based in North Yorkshire, UK. Hopeless but entusiastic fell runner, Ancient history nerd 
and lover of the great outdoors. 

This blog is just a collection of my own notes, for reference. If you find anything useful here - then that's grand.
If you want to get in touch, my Twitter  handle is below.

Thanks for stopping by!
